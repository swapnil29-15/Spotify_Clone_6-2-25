# Spotify Clone  <br>
This is my first project which i have made by using html and css. I have currently only worked on frontend work. By keeping aside orignal spotify website i started making and working on spotify website. Although it is not much attractive website but still working on such website boost my experince in fields of websites making. All the images of singers and icons images i have taken from google. Font is used from google.font . My next target will be working on backend. Adding more song making and making it listneable.
Working on backend by learning javascript language which will make more attractive and user-friendly.
